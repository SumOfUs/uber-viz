        Over the last few months, public disgust for Uber has reached a fever pitch. As the company lurches from one scandal to another, it almost seems like Uber can't catch a break. But taking a look at the company's behavior over the last few years, it's easy to see why so many people are so angry with Uber. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Time and time again, Uber's aggressive expansion plans have led it to flout the law, bully competitors, and mistreat its employees. Finally, the consequences of Uber's callous behavior are catching up with it.

      <p>
        Through our research, we have identified a nine-step “playbook” for Uber’s pattern of behavior across the globe. You can scroll down to read about it below, or take a closer look at our data on the <a href="/map">interactive map</a>.

        <h2>The Uber playbook</h2>
        <p>
          There's no denying the convenience of ride-sharing apps, but Uber has chosen to expand its reach in a singularly ruthless manner. Billions of dollars of venture capital financing give Uber the power to use unrealistic pricing to build dependence among customers and drivers. And that financing comes with demands - demands from investors that Uber grow globally at any cost. This has led the company to engage in behavior ranging from the questionable to the outrageous, and repeat its exploits in city after city and country after country.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Uber has disrupted transportation economies around the world, the company's playbook has become clear. By studying its pattern of behavior, we've been able to identify each step in Uber's method for entering, dominating, and exploiting new markets around the globe.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Market entry</h3>
            In most cases, Uber will start to operate in a location without seeking permission from regulators, or officially clarifying the position. They will insist that their model is not catered to in pre-existing regulations, which therefore cannot be held to apply to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Driver recruitment</h3>
            Uber needs a critical mass of drivers on the street in order to provide a usable service to riders. To achieve this, the outset it offers an attractive deal to drivers, tempting them away from legacy taxi cab firms. Thus, fares are offered at below cost price, effectively funded by a series of multibillion-dollar private investments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Use riders as a political base</h3>
            By establishing itself before the authorities have time to react, Uber establishes a political support base amongst city-dwellers who value its convenience and relative affordability. PR stunts – such as free rides, presents for riders, or the delivery of everything from ice cream to puppies – cements the company’s appealing image.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Look for political influence in more traditional ways too</h3>
            Uber will meanwhile recruit an army of well-connected local lobbyists to press its case
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Ignore or fight regulations when possible, settle high risk lawsuits</h3>
            For as long as it can, Uber will fight or ignore regulations, until an official crackdown becomes impossible to ignore. The company will pay the fines and costs of drivers arrested for working without a licence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Some regulations can be accepted</h3>
            There are certain things Uber won’t give ground on. But in some cases, such as paying for drivers’ insurance, or even a small tax on fares, it can stand to take a hit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Brush off protests from  competition</h3>
            The legacy taxi industry in each location will be hard-hit, often seeing a decline in their income of up to or around 50%. Legacy taxi drivers will often resort to protests, blocking roads, and in extreme cases, violent protests and attacks on taxi drivers. Uber may set up a rapid response private security force in order to rescue its drivers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reduce fares, increase commission, increase driver numbers</h3>
            Once Uber has established local market dominance, it’s time to turn a profit, and that means cutting fares and increasing its commission. It argues that lower fares, which make rides more frequent, can actually increase drivers’ income by reducing downtime, a phenomenon known as ‘Uber math’. But drivers often report that their earnings have been slashed without consultation, or even warning. The company also recruit more and more drivers – a process which adds to waiting times for drivers, but reduces them for riders, and hence drives down income.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Rinse and repeat</h3>
            Uber is always expanding, and before this process is complete in one location, it’s on to the next.
